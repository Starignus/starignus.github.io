I am highly motivated, an enthusiastic **Data Scientist** with experience in coding and performing data analysis. I was trained as a physicist, and during my PhD,  I specialised in quantum mechanics simulations that provide insights into the correlation between the atomic structure of materials and the unusual physical properties they display which can lead to significant technological applications (e.g. high-temperature superconductivity, corrosion inhibition, optoelectronics.

## What are my goals?

I am pursuing a career as a Data Scientist and passionate about applying new technologies, machine learning, and data analytics to understand human behaviour, make strategic business decisions and develop products that help to improve people’s lives. I think we live in an age of turning data into innovative business and technological solutions, so I want to be part of that!

## More about my background

I have a degree in Physics from [**Universidad de las Américas Puebla**](http://www.udlap.mx/), and a PhD in Physics (Computational Material Science) from [**The National Autonomous University of Mexico**](http://www.fisica.unam.mx/). As a postdoctoral researcher, I worked at the [**Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich**](http://www.kristallographie.geowissenschaften.uni-muenchen.de/forschung/compmatsci/index.html), [**Juelich Forschungszentrum**](http://www.fz-juelich.de/portal/EN/AboutUs/organizational_structure/Institutes/InstituteEnergyClimate/_node.html). Afterwards, I came to the UK to work at [**Imperial College London**](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/). Science is also about working in multicultural environments; you can always get to know interesting things about the culture of colleagues.

I became excited about Data Science field during my last year of postdoc, and I decided to participate in the [**Science to Data Science**](http://www.s2ds.org/) summer program organised by [Pivigo](https://www.pivigo.com/). After five weeks of intensive work learning together and having fun with my team, we delivered a prototype a price optimisation model which could yield multi-million-pound returns to one of the biggest car parts distributor of UK, the Parts Alliance Group. The best of the journey was to work with my team [(and **won the best presentation award together**)!](https://www.dataiq.co.uk/blog/data-sciences-champagne-supernova) I love to work with people of different backgrounds to learn to see things from a different sight.

## Innovating in the world!

During my time at Imperial College, I co-founded along with my friend [Jing Sheng Pang](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/jingshengpang), the concept of [**Neuron Technology Ltd**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/11064056/), also part of the [ICAH startups](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/advanced-hackspace/portfolio/startups/). We were looking for improving the working environment using data collected by IoT;  the idea is creating a community aided building management system to improve user experience and building efficiency to reduce carbon footprints and enhancing users working areas. If you want to chat about Raspberry Pi and building a web app with Python, or anything to do with IoT, just give me a shout!

## Hobbies

As you have noticed, I love Science! I am naturally curious and decided to become a physicist when I was five years old (one day I should post about the story). I like to inspire and make people think and feel curious. Therefore, I collaborate in a blog of popular science in Spanish, called [**"Pedazos de Carbono"**](http://blog.carbono.xyz/), to boost critical thinking in Latin American countries. Other of my hobbies is attending Meetups, especially those that get involve women in tech areas. I love cooking (check my [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/qflavours)), running, Bikram Yoga, painting, handicraft, take pics in Instagram and playing the guitar. But I love the most being part of the life of my friends which are around the world, but close to my heart :-).

An excellent starting to my Saturday is preparing fried eggs with shapes of a stars, astronauts and space rockets!
