The last winter term I enjoyed as the instructor on the Raspberry Pi and Python programming of the [**Gizmo (Physical Computing)**](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/design-engineering/study/meng/modules/year-2/gizmo-physical-computing/) workshop along with my friend [Jing Sheng Pang](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/jingshengpang). It is a module of the program second year of the [**MEng in Design Engineering at the Dyson School of Design Engineering at Imperial College**](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/design-engineering/study/meng/). At the end of the sessions, the students will be challenged to design and produce functioning prototypes, demonstrating principles, for a machine that effectively integrates machine elements, sensors and actuators and software to perform a specified function. I was thrilled to see the outcome of all the effort of the students.  

One of my favourites ones (because I could help just a bit on the programming side), was the work of designed and developed by Ina Roll Backe, Tilly Supple, Carla Urbano, and Bea Lopez. They constructed the BMIC, which is a mechanical drum sequencer. From a 4x3 step sequencer controller, the user can input combinations of beats and instruments. The inputs are interpreted by a programmed Raspberry Pi, that sends output to three solenoids accordingly, each attached to a drum hitting mechanism. I enjoyed the show of the BMIC.
