Every morning when you wake up,  you give for granted that you will be back home after work, that you will share dinner with your family and friends, or maybe go out with your buddies to the cinema or for a drink. Others, wake up and take their children to school and their dog to walk. You and your partner tell to each other to have a good day.  You take the tube or bus to work, and perhaps you walk on a bridge or a large street. But **who knows when and how a terrorist attack could happen that kills all that you love**. What would you do to save their lives or to protect them? How could you help others after the shock? We can not prevent the harmful actions of humans so easily, but we can not, for sure, avoid the destruction of natural phenomena like hurricanes, tornadoes, typhoons, floods, **EARTHQUAKES**, volcano eruptions, etc.

Imagine that instead of a human taking away the lives of your loved ones, it is an **EARTHQUAKE**. The building where you live collapsed and has been reduced to rubble. Your mother, father, and sister could not escape. After three days of constant work from volunteers and the military, they know **they are dead** and, to rescue the bodies, they will need heavy machinery to remove the debris of what you called once home. Where you collected memories, and what is more the remains of **what you loved the most, your family. You were left behind without nothing, and perhaps you barely have money to give them a proper burial**. Also, you can imagine yourself, buried in the building remains where you work. You can barely move, you are stuck, and your lungs can just get a mixture of air and dust. You can't see anything, and you can listen to the noise of moving rocks. You will think you will die since your ribs are broken. How long you can wait for help, perhaps you will never see your loved ones again. **Every second counts and the waiting is so long**.

You can also imagine taking your child to school at morning. You gave a hug and kissed and let the kid go waving the hand. You never thought that it was going to be the last time you saw him or her alive. The child was trapped for hours under the rubble of the school; you were waiting overnight until they told you the news. All that I have narrated had happened, and there are more real stories like these of the **earthquake disaster of 7.1 the past 19th of September of 2017**. This time the epicentre was in the state of Morelos which is about 150 Km from Mexico City (the earthquake alarm was activated too late due to this reason) displaying a mixture of trepidatory and oscillatory motion. Exactly on the same date 32 years ago, one of the biggest disasters in Mexico due to an earthquake (8.1 magnitude with an epicentre near to Michoacan coast about 800 Km from Mexico City) were about 10 000 people died—unofficial records reckon 40 000 deads just in Mexico City.  Also, we should not forget that about two weeks before, on the 7th of September of 2017, the hardest earthquake of the century in Mexico hit with an epicentre in Chiapas, one of the poorest states in the country [1].

As 32 years ago, many residents of Mexico City ("chilangos") are volunteering to help the military specialist to remove the debris to find people alive. They have worked continuously, without sleep. They strive to the end, and the motor that drives them is the empathy to find someone **ALIVE**. The civilians organise themselves to bring food, water to the other volunteers. On the other hand, many are helping to provide supplies to the temporary collection centres. The millennial generation is helping on the streets and some others collaborating in coding to make informative websites and apps that can be accessed for free. People living in the other affected states are also pushing to help the most that they can. Many communities in the countryside in Mexico which are impoverished are also the most affected, people are sleeping outdoors and may have to do it for months. I can type many words, but you can see it for yourself in the images and videos I am sharing here.

We, Mexicans, have been portrayed by foreign movies with hats, lazy and drinking. Eating "chilli con carne", burritos, and tacos in hard shells (all of that is Tex-Mex) which, honestly, I had never seen in my life until I moved abroad. It is true that many things are corrupted, that there are violence, femicides, substantial gender inequality. But how it could not be like that if there is no chance for the poor to grow and to be educated.  According to the  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD):  "most Mexicans have low educational attainment (63% have only below upper secondary education); and the proportion of adults who have attained at least upper secondary education (37%) is one of the smallest among OECD countries, and is considerably below the OECD average" [2].

How people can have access to more opportunities and education if the 2017 **basic salary of a Mexican is about € 2,081 annually before taxes (€ 95.6 monthly). The national average salary is €4,150 annually (€ 345.7 monthly) [3, 4, 5, 6]**. How can you support a family with that? We, Mexicans, are hard workers and earning a little salary (barely there are holidays). **The OECD reported that average employee in Mexico works 2,246 hours annually, the average employee in the world works 1,766 hours, and Germans are producing more capital for the least hours worked, 1,371 hours [7]**. Of course, we are manufacturer workers, and companies from abroad invest in cheap labour. There are high qualified Mexicans but is more likely that a middle-class child can have better opportunities, regardless of attendance to a private or public education. The new generation is working hard in learning, but few can access to internet to take free courses online (manly in the cities).

We, Mexicans, despite all the disadvantages in our country, we love our nation, our home, our PEOPLE. I consider myself a citizen of the world, and I feel hopeless of not being able to make a significant change about all the unfairness, ignorance, and prejudice in my country. But after this event, something struck in my heart, I saw that part of my people that I have not seen for too long, **EMPATHY, SOLIDARITY,  and LOVE for another human**. We have a resilient spirit, and we try our best until the end. But we can not do it alone in this hard times. I ask you to consider donating to organisations providing emergency relief (**£1 ≈ $24 MXN pesos**, so any little help goes a long way!)  Most of the images of destruction in media come from the cities, but many small and poor towns are also suffering. In the next months, many households must be rebuilt, and Mexico will need to rise fundings. If you can help or share this information, we will be grateful, and our hearts will not feel hopeless.

**I am a lucky Mexican woman**; by chance, I was born in a land of sunshine within a middle-class family. I got access to public education and scholarships to attain my BSc until my PhD.  I am the only person within my closest family holding a PhD. I am an outlier of the distribution of the Mexican females population; I just got lucky to have a better fate even if I had worked hard for it. **But also I feel fortunate to have close friends over the world with 38 nationalities who I know could help me to distribute this information to reach more people to help Mexico**.

## What to Know Before You Donate? (piece taken from the [*nytimes*](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/20/reader-center/donate-mexico-earthquake-.html?mcubz=1))

Before deciding where to donate your money, don’t be afraid to ask tough questions.

“There are a lot of individuals in times of disaster that will take advantage of the emotional response people will have,” Sara Nason, a spokeswoman for the nonprofit watchdog Charity Navigator, said in a phone interview.

The Charity Navigator website, which rates United States charitable organizations, is a good place to start when researching a nonprofit, as it does much of the legwork for you. It recently posted [**a list of reputable charities**](http://blog.charitynavigator.org/2017/09/earthquake-in-mexico.html) that are helping in Mexico.

Ask questions and seek detailed answers. Has the nonprofit explained how it is going to use its funds? Does it have a specific destination for funds donated to relief efforts?

Vetting international groups can be trickier.

“One difficulty that we see in vetting international organizations is that there is no large standardized body that takes in validated information about these organizations,” Ms. Nason said.

Enter GlobalGiving. The crowdfunding charity works with organizations in 170 countries, [**including Mexico**](https://www.globalgiving.org/dy/v2/content/search.html?q=*&fq=country:Mexico), to deliver much-needed funds to local nonprofits that are doing immediate recovery work.
